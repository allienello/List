In this project, I created a program that creates a sorted linked list from a data file. Each line of data is stored in a class object called node that contains a First Name, Last Name, Age, and a pointer to the next node in the list.

I created a container class called list to store the nodes in a sorted linked list. As nodes are created, I inserted them into the list in alphabetical order. The list class cleans up memory when it is destroyed.  

The Main.cpp and Node.h files were given by the instructor, and the rest was implemented by me.

This project was for my introduction to programming II class at university. Using my knowledge from class, I implemented the necessary algorithms/code. I also used my course materials (lecture slides and textbooks) and advice from the professor.
